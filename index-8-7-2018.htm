  <p>The link between science and music is mathematics. Computers can make sound from mathematical calculations. This is <a href="http://dietpumpkinmachine.com">Diet Pumpkin Machine</a>, an experiment with computational waves. It will calculate forms from parameterized equations (or data samples) and encode them into a digital audio artifact. </p>
  <p>I work on this in my spare time at work and school where I often log in to different computers each day. I use a cloud development platform so that I can pick up where I left off at the previous day no matter where I sit. I try to avoid Java and Visual Studio because I find them clunky to work with. I also prefer to keep program execution on the client side because server resources are limited and expensive. For these reasons I chose ECMAscript for the implementation.</p>
  <p>I will encode the results in Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) under the Ogg-Vorbis audio format.</p>
