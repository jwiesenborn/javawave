Description<br/>
This project computes sound waves in JavaScript and encodes the output for playback on a computer speaker.<br/>
<br/>
User Interface (new!)<br/>
User interface for typing in musical sequence codes (index.htm). There is a demo at [jesusplaysmaracas.com](http://jesusplaysmaracas.com/).<br/>
<br/>
File Encoding<br/>
Includes functions for encoding data in canonical "WAVE PCM soundfile format" as specified at http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/<br/>
<br/>
Math-Based Acoustics<br/>
To compute notes with a given frequency, it creates an 8- or 16-bit array and populates each byte from the basic equation y = sin(2Ï€ * x * f).<br/>
<br/>
Sequence Offsets<br/>
Recalculate each vertical coordinate to connect the signals in sequence where different notes or rests form gaps in the data signal.<br/>
<br/>
Soundwave Visualizations<br/>
Use the Canvas element to draw data forms as computed for review.<br/>
<br/>
MusicXML<br/>
Functions for processing MusicXML file input and generating audio sound as output<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Dr. Vanderburg for help with the version control project at North Dakota State University.
